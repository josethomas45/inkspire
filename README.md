Inkspire â€“ Artistic E-Commerce Platform ðŸŽ¨
This project provides a clean and minimalistic e-commerce platform for artists and collectors, built with modern frontend tools and focused on performance, aesthetics, and user experience.

Currently, the platform supports:

Artwork browsing by type, theme, and artist

Add to cart, wishlist, and secure checkout flow

Artist profiles and storytelling behind each piece

Gen Z-inspired design with responsive UI and animations

Expanding the functionality
If you are developing a production-ready version of Inkspire, we recommend:

Adding a headless CMS like Sanity or Strapi for scalable content management

Integrating Stripe or Razorpay for advanced payment support

Using NextAuth/Auth.js for secure authentication

Connecting Resend or Brevo for transactional emails

Enabling analytics (e.g., Google Analytics or PostHog) to track user behavior

Check out the Next.js documentation and Tailwind CSS to customize and extend this project for your needs.
