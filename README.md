# Inkspire â€“ Artistic E-Commerce Platform ðŸŽ¨  
Inkspire is a clean, minimalistic e-commerce platform crafted for artists and collectors. Itâ€™s built with a modern tech stack and focuses on performance, visual storytelling, and an aesthetic Gen Z experience. Users can explore, discover, and purchase unique artworks including digital illustrations, custom prints, and more â€” all while connecting with the stories behind the creators.

## Currently Supported Features  
Users can browse art by type, theme, or artist, add items to a wishlist or cart, and experience a secure checkout. The platform includes artist profiles, high-quality previews, and responsive UI with smooth animations, offering an intuitive and engaging art-buying experience.

### Expanding the Functionality  
For production use, we recommend integrating a headless CMS like Sanity or Strapi for scalable content management, implementing secure authentication via Auth.js or NextAuth, and enabling payments through Stripe or Razorpay. Email communication can be powered by Resend or Brevo. Analytics tools like Google Analytics or PostHog can provide valuable user insights.

## Developer Stack  
This project uses Next.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Resend for email integration, and Auth.js for authentication. The design emphasizes clean layout, performance, and a mobile-first experience.
