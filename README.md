# Inkspire â€“ Artistic E-Commerce Platform ðŸŽ¨  
Inkspire is a clean, minimalistic e-commerce platform designed to offer a curated, limited collection of artworks from a single artist. The platform provides a streamlined, focused buying experience, where users can purchase only the currently available pieces â€” no browsing through large catalogs, just a direct and exclusive selection of art. Built with modern tech and a Gen Z-inspired aesthetic, **Inkspire** brings unique art into the hands of passionate collectors.

## Currently Supported Features  
Users can view and purchase the currently available art pieces, with detailed product descriptions and high-quality previews. The platform ensures a secure and smooth checkout process, offering a straightforward, no-frills shopping experience for art lovers. The artist profile includes background information, giving buyers insight into their creative journey.

### Expanding the Functionality  
For production use, we recommend integrating secure authentication via Auth.js or NextAuth, enabling payments through Stripe or Razorpay, and providing an efficient checkout flow. Email communication can be powered by Resend or Brevo. Analytics tools like Google Analytics can provide valuable insights into user behavior.

## Developer Stack  
This project uses Next.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, Resend for email integration, and Auth.js for authentication. The design focuses on simplicity, performance, and a mobile-first experience.
